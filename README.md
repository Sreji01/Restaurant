# Restaurant_Software_System
Developed the reservation and ordering system for a mid-sized restaurant desktop application, focusing on a clean, user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation and interactive menu displays. 
Built the frontend using Java Swing to provide a responsive desktop UI, while the backend was implemented in Java with JDBC for database communication and SQL for managing reservations, orders, and menu data. 
Socket programming was used to enable real-time communication between the client and server, ensuring synchronized updates for multiple users.
